# 2016 election

Concerns about **automated accounts, or bots, on social media** manipulating public opinion reached a fever pitch during the 2016 general election. 

The most alarming concerns were related to behaviors of **Kremlin-linked bots** for:

+ pushing **fake news** stories

+ amplifying **social divisions**

+ misrepresenting **public opinion**

---

# Research question(s)

## How do we **identify bots on social media**?

## How can we do it in **real-time** so as to filter out inauthentic social media traffic?

# Social media data

---

# Social media apps

There's been a lot of talk about Cambridge Analytica's abuse of social media data. **Reactions** can be summarized as follows:

1. **Facebook was negligent** because it inadequately regulated third party apps

1. **Cambridge Analytica was unethical** because it stole and used data they shouldn't have

&amp;nbsp;

In other words...people don't know exactly what FB and CA actually did, but they know it was wrong.

---

# Social media APIs

Social media platforms encourage and regulate third party applications via **APIs**
+ **Application Program Interfaces** (APIs) are sets of protocols that govern interactions between sites and users

Similar to web browsers but with different primary objective:
+ Web browsers **render content**
+ Web APIs **organize data**

For public APIs, many sites only allow access to **authorized** users
+ Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Github, etc.

---

# Twitter vs. Facebook

For a case study about political bots on social media, Twitter is better because...

1. It's more open about its **data**
   + Unlike Facebook, which actually clamped down on data sharing (with developers) starting in 2014, **Twitter is quite open with its data**

1. It's more **public facing**
   + **Default privacy setting** is public
   + User **connections** are asymmetrical

# Twitter APIs

To connect to Twitter APIs, users need a **consumer key** and **consumer secret**, which you can get by creating a Twitter app.

View the built-in vignette **`auth`** for instructions on obtaining and storing user access tokens.&lt;sup&gt;\* &lt;/sup&gt;


```r
## view rtweet's authorization vignette
vignette("auth", package = "rtweet")
```

Or look up the vignette online: [rtweet.info/articles/auth.html](http://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html)

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt; \* &lt;/sup&gt; For a while, rtweet users were not required to create their own Twitter applications. [That recently changed](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet/issues/179#issuecomment-365689068), but hopefully it's resolved soon.
]

# Create a Twitter App

&lt;span&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt; Log in to your [Twitter.com](https://twitter.com) account

&lt;span&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt; Go to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/) and select **Create New App**

&lt;span style="margin-left:15%"&gt;&lt;img src="img/createnewapp.png" width="60%" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

---

&lt;span&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; Complete the fields (**important**: Callback URL must be exact)
  - Name: `{{initials}}_twitter_app`
  - Description: `{{something about analyzing Twitter data}}`
  - Website: `https://twitter.com/{{you_screen_name}}`
  - **Callback URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:1410`

&lt;span style="margin-left:15%"&gt;&lt;img src="img/creating.png" width="60%" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt; Store name of app as `app_name` in R script


```r
## name of twitter app
app_name &lt;- "mwk_twitter_app"
```

---

# Copy API keys

&lt;span&gt;5.&lt;/span&gt; Click **Create your Twitter application**

&lt;span&gt;6.&lt;/span&gt; Select **Keys and Access Tokens** tab

&lt;span&gt;7.&lt;/span&gt; Copy the **Consumer Key (API Key)** and **Consumer Secret (API Secret)** and paste into R script

&lt;span style="margin-left:15%"&gt;&lt;img src="img/keys.png" width="60%" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


```r
## copy and pasted *your* keys (these are fake)
consumer_key &lt;- "XYznzPFOFZR2a39FwWKN1Jp41"
consumer_secret &lt;- "CtkGEWmSevZqJuKl6HHrBxbCybxI1xGLqrD5ynPd9jG0SoHZbD"
```

---

# Create your token

&lt;span&gt;8.&lt;/span&gt; Pass the stored values to `create_token()` to create the Twitter authorization token.


```r
## create token
token &lt;- create_token(app_name, consumer_key, consumer_secret)

## print token
token
```

---

# Storing your token

Every request sent to Twitter must include a token. Save yourself trouble by storing it as an environment variable.


```r
## save token to home directory
path_to_token &lt;- file.path(path.expand("~"), ".twitter_token.rds")
saveRDS(token, path_to_token)

## create env variable TWITTER_PAT (with path to saved token)
env_var &lt;- paste0("TWITTER_PAT=", path_to_token)

## save as .Renviron file (or append if the file already exists)
cat(env_var, file = file.path(path.expand("~"), ".Renviron"),
  fill = TRUE, append = TRUE)
```

Normally `.Renviron` is processed on start-up, so refresh it.


```r
## refresh .Renviron variables
readRenviron("~/.Renviron")
```


---

# Getting the data

**{rtweet}** functions correspond to different [API] paths. For example, user timelines:


```r
cnn &lt;- get_timeline("cnn", n = 3200)
ts_plot(cnn, "hours")
```

&lt;span style="margin-left:1%"&gt;&lt;img src="img/cnn.png" width="90%" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

# Identifying bots

---

# Current approach

The creators of [**botometer**](https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/#!/) maintain a list open sourced academic studies that identified bots.

But this approach is not without **limitations**:
+ Academic research moves slowly (especially with Twitter banning many of the bots)
+ Relatively small number have been collected
+ Labor intensive methods (human coding)

---

# New approach

One **solution** to these limitations is to combine the academic sources with an easy-to-automate method that takes advantage of naturally occurring human coding

1. Select a handful of previously **verified** bots
1. Look up the public **lists** that include those bots
1. Identify list **names** that self identify as bot lists
   - Perform validity checks on other listed accounts

# Compiling data sets

---

# User/tweet data

Using the list of screen names for non-bot (based on previous academic research and human coding) and bot accounts, I gathered...

+ **tweet-level data** for the most recent 100 tweets posted by each user `rtweet::get_timelines()`

+ **user-level (or account-level) data** for each user `rtweet::lookup_users()`

The data returned by Twitter consists of over 60 features related to the tweet and author (user) of each tweet.

---

# Data sets

Randomly sample Twitter data into train and test data sets

+ **Train data**: approx. 70% of users in sample
   - Making sure there are a roughly equal number of bots and non-bots

+ **Test data**: remaining (30%) bot and non-bot accounts

---

# Features

In addition to the numeric variables already returned by Twitter, I used **{textfeatures}** to extract up to 26 features for each textual variable.

The text features were extracted for:

+ Tweets
+ Name
+ Screen name
+ Location
+ Description (bio)

# Modeling

---

# Two models

Two models were created. 

1. The **default model**, which uses both users and tweets data.
   - Rate limited by Twitter to 180 every 15 minutes
   
1. The **fast model**, which uses only users data
   - Rate limited by Twitter to 90,000 every 15 minutes

---

# Model results

A gradient boosted logistic model **{gbm::gbm()}** was trained and tested on the two data sets for both the default and fast models.

+ The **default model** was 93.53% accurate when classifying bots and 95.32% accurate when classifying non-bots

+ The **fast model** was 91.78% accurate when classifying bots and 92.61% accurate when classifying non-bots

Overall...

+ The **default model** was correct 93.8% of the time

+ The **fast model** was correct 91.9% of the time.

# Applications

+ This has since been assembled into an R package [**{botrnot}**](https://github.com/mkearney/botrnot)---coming soon to CRAN!

+ It has also been exported as a [Shiny web app](https://mikewk.shinyapps.io/botornot)

Future directions

---

# Future research

Between the proliferation of news stories about Kremlin-linked bots on social media and the number of false positives reported to me about **botrnot**, I'm starting to think...

The real challenge is not **identifying** social media bots but instead **defining** what is means to be a *bot* on social media

+ Future research should examine how and why people define certain accounts as bots and others as not bots
